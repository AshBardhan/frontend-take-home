# Harbor Take Home (Frontend)

Welcome to the Harbor frontend take home assignment. We hope this is a good opportunity for you to showcase your skills.

# Prerequisites

There is a simple express server in this repo that will serve some dummy data. To start the server, install the packages and run `yarn start:server`.
You can then access the data via `GET localhost:3000/testnets`

# The Challenge
